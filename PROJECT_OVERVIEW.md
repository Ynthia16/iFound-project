# iFound - My Complete Lost & Found System

## What I Built
I created iFound because I wanted to solve a real problem - people losing important documents and having no way to find them. This is a complete system with a mobile app for users and an admin dashboard for management. Everything connects through Firebase so it's all real-time and actually works in the real world.

## How to Run & Test

### Mobile App (User Side)
1. `cd ifound_app`
2. `flutter pub get`
3. `flutter run`
- Register as a user and try all the features I built (report, search, notifications, etc.)

### Admin Dashboard (Admin Side)
1. `cd admin_dashboard`
2. `flutter pub get`
3. `flutter run -d chrome`
- Register as an admin and explore all the management features I created

**No demo credentials needed. Anyone can register and test - I made it super easy!**

## Key Features I Implemented

### For Users (Mobile App)
- Register/login instantly - no waiting around
- Report lost or found items (with details, photos, location) - everything you need
- Search and filter all reports - find what you're looking for quickly
- Get real-time notifications for matches - this was fun to implement!
- Multi-language (English, French, Kinyarwanda) - made it accessible for everyone
- Dark mode and accessibility - everyone should be able to use it

### For Admins (Dashboard)
- View/manage all users (search, filter, delete, change roles) - full control
- View/manage all reports (search, filter, mark resolved, delete) - handle everything efficiently
- Analytics dashboard (live stats, trends, success rates) - see how the system is doing
- Audit logs (see all admin actions, real-time) - keep track of everything
- System settings (notifications, backup, language, theme) - customize as needed
- Bulk actions and data export - save time with batch operations

## What Makes My System Special
- **Everything is real data** (no fake stuff) - it actually works
- **Live, real-time updates** across all screens - pretty cool to see
- **Modern, intuitive UI** for both users and admins - spent a lot of time on this
- **Supervisor-friendly:**
  - No setup in Firebase Console required - I handled all the backend
  - No demo credentials needed - just register and go!
  - Just register and use - made it as simple as possible
- **Security:** Role-based access, audit logs, and strong authentication - kept it secure
- **Ready for demo:** All features are accessible and testable out-of-the-box

## Capstone-Ready
- Full-stack, real-world system - not just a demo
- Clean, professional code and UI - I'm proud of this
- All documentation up to date - made sure everything is clear
- Easy for supervisors to test and evaluate - they can just jump right in
